# Tic-Tac-Toe-project

This is a basic project building the application Tic-Tac_Toe game for 2 players using Java Swing

The rule is the machine will randomly choose a person to play first. Each player then takes turn and tries to form a line of 3 successive "X"s or 3 "O"s, vertically or horizontally or diagonally.
If all blocks are filled but the winning condition is not fulfilled yet then it is a draw.
