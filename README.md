## Project overview

   - Tic Tac Toe is a simple and class game where two players take turns marking the space in a 3x3 grid with either an "X" or and "O". The player who succeeds in forming a line of 3 successive marks vertically or horizontally or diagonally wins the game.
   - This project is an implementation of Tic Tac Toe game in Java Swing, which can be played locally on your computer. The game provides a graphical user interface, which enables 2 players to play against each other interactively.
